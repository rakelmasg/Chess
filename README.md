# Chess Game

Chess Game is a complete chess implementation in C++, featuring piece movement logic, official rules, and game state management.

## Key Features

  - **Command** for move execution and undo  
  - **State** for managing game and UI states  
  - **Factory** for creating chess pieces  
  - **Flyweight** to efficiently share movement strategies  
  - **Composite** for board and cell hierarchy  
  - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for clear separation of concerns
- Text-based console interface for gameplay.
- Modular and extensible for easy future improvements.
